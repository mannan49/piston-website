        <p>The typical piston design is on the picture. This type of piston is widely used in car diesel engines. According to purpose, supercharging level and working conditions of engines the shape and proportions can be changed.
            Gas sealing is achieved by the use of piston rings. These are a number of narrow iron rings, fitted loosely into grooves in the piston, just below the crown. The rings are split at a point in the rim, allowing them to press against the cylinder with a light spring pressure. Two types of ring are used: the upper rings have solid faces and provide gas sealing; lower rings have narrow edges and a U-shaped profile, to act as oil scrapers. There are many proprietary and detail design features associated with piston rings.

            The main advantages of the Piston are:
            <li>Mechanical simplicity</li>
            <li>Flexibility and reliability</li>
            <li>Low turbine operating temperature</li>
            <li>Low NO<sub>X</sub> emissions</li>
        </ul>
